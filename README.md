# SQL Agent

SQL Agent is an AI-powered tool that allows you to interact with your SQL databases using natural language. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, simply ask questions in plain English, and let our AI do the work for you.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries:** Ask questions about your data in plain English.
- **SQL Transparency:** View the generated SQL queries for each response.
- **Database Schema Understanding:** The AI automatically analyzes your database structure.
- **Intelligent Query Routing:** Uses a supervisor agent to determine the best way to answer your questions.

## How It Works

1. Upload your SQLite database file.
2. Ask questions about your data in natural language.
3. The supervisor agent determines whether to use SQL or RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to answer your question.
4. Get comprehensive answers with the option to view the underlying SQL queries.
